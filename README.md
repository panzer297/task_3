# SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Task 3

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written for basic to intermediate-level data analysis on an eCommerce dataset. The goal of this task was to explore, manipulate, and analyze structured data using SQL across different concepts like filtering, joins, aggregation, and indexing.

All queries and their corresponding outputs (screenshots) are included together in a single `.sql` file for easy reference and review.

## What's Included

- ðŸ“Œ SQL queries for different analysis tasks  
- ðŸ“¸ Screenshots of the output (pasted next to the queries for better clarity)  
- ðŸ—‚ Queries organized by topic for readability  
- ðŸ›  Basic performance optimization using indexes  
- ðŸ§¾ Views created for better analysis of top customers

## Topics Covered

- Filtering data with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Grouping and summarizing with `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `AVG`
- Different types of `JOINs` (LEFT JOIN and simulated RIGHT JOIN)
- Subqueries to compare against averages
- Creating SQL views to simplify repeated analysis
- Creating indexes to improve query performance

## Quick Preview

Some of the key queries you'll find:

- Orders placed from Germany  
- Top 5 best-selling products  
- Revenue generated by each country  
- Invoice-level purchase summaries  
- Customers who spent more than the average  
- A view showing top 10 customers based on total spend  
- Indexes created on frequently used columns to speed up queries  

## How to Use

You can open the `.sql` file with your preferred SQL tool (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or DB Browser for SQLite), and walk through the queries. Each query block is followed by its output screenshot, so you can immediately see what kind of result is expected.

## Final Thoughts

This task helped me understand how to use SQL not just to retrieve data, but to actually *analyze* it â€” making sense of patterns, customer behavior, and sales performance. It was a hands-on exercise in writing clean queries, thinking through join logic, and presenting insights clearly.
